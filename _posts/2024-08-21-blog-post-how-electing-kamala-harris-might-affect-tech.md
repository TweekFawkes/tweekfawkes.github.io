## How Electing Kamala Harris Might Affect Tech

Speculation about future presidents is a popular pastime, but it's usually not very productive. No one really knows what a candidate will do once in office. Campaign promises often bear little resemblance to actual policies. And technology moves so fast that the landscape can change dramatically during a single term.

That said, it's worth thinking about how a Kamala Harris presidency might affect cybersecurity and AI over the next five years, if only as a thought experiment. Harris has a background as a prosecutor and served as Attorney General of California. So she likely has more familiarity with cybercrime and digital security issues than the average politician.

During her time as a senator and on the campaign trail, Harris has made some statements about wanting to regulate big tech companies more strictly. She's expressed concern about data privacy and the spread of misinformation online. But beyond a few broad strokes, she hasn't laid out many specifics.

On AI, Harris seems generally supportive of continued research and development. She's talked about the potential benefits of AI in healthcare and other fields. But she's also warned about the need for ethical guidelines and oversight as the technology advances.

So what might this mean in practice? It's possible we'd see more federal resources devoted to cybersecurity under a Harris administration. There could be a push for stricter data protection laws similar to Europe's GDPR. We might see more scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions in the tech sector.

For AI, Harris might increase government funding for research while also creating new regulatory bodies to monitor its development. She could champion workforce retraining programs to help workers adapt to AI-driven automation.

But here's the thing: presidents have less direct influence over technology than you might think. Most of the real action happens in the private sector, in academic labs, and through the decisions of individual developers and entrepreneurs.

No matter who's in the White House, the most important drivers of progress in cybersecurity and AI will be the people actually building things. The programmers finding new ways to encrypt data and defend networks. The researchers pushing the boundaries of machine learning. The startups coming up with novel applications we haven't even imagined yet.

What really matters is having an environment that allows innovation to flourish while providing reasonable safeguards. Good policy can help create that environment. But it's not the main event.

So if you're a young person interested in shaping the future of cybersecurity or AI, becoming a politician is probably not the most effective path. You'd likely have far more impact by studying computer science, starting a company, or joining a cutting-edge research lab.

The next big breakthrough in these fields is more likely to come from a dorm room or garage than the Oval Office. That's not to say policy doesn't matter at all. But the real action is happening at the ground level, driven by curious people tinkering with new ideas.

So rather than wondering how any particular election might affect technology, a better question might be: how can I position myself to be one of the people actually building the future? That's where the leverage is. And it's a much more productive line of inquiry than trying to predict the actions of politicians.
