## How to Set Perplexity as Chrome's Default Search Engine

To set Perplexity AI as your default search engine in Google Chrome, follow these steps:

- Open Google Chrome on your computer.
- Click on the three vertical dots in the top-right corner of the browser window to open the Chrome menu.
- Click on "Settings" from the drop-down menu.
- In the left-hand sidebar, click on "Search engine" link.
- Click on "Manage search engines and site search".
- Within the "Site search" section and click on the "Add" button.
- In the dialog that appears, fill in the following details:
  - Name: Perplexity AI
  - Shortcut: @perplexity
  - URL: https://www.perplexity.ai/search?q=%s
- Click "Add" to save.
- Click on the three dots next to Perplexity AI and select "Make default" from the drop-down menu.

Now when you perform a search (e.g. within the address bar of the chrome browser) it should automatically use Perplexity AI for the search! :)

FYI, you can also use the shortcut (@perplexity) in the address bar to quickly search with Perplexity AI even if it's not set as the default search engine

You can also modify the google shortcut so instead of pointing to `google.com` it points to `@google`, which will enable you to use the shortcut (@google) to search using google's search engine.
